        <h1>Privacy Policy for PIP CodeWindow</h1>

        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> May 14, 2025</p> <p>
            Thank you for using PIP CodeWindow (the "Extension"), created by me, AiNoYash (Yash Kapadiya).
            This Privacy Policy outlines how the Extension handles your information. Your privacy is important to me,
            and this policy is intended to be transparent about my practices.
        </p>

        <h2>1. What the Extension Does</h2>
        <p>
            PIP CodeWindow enhances your Browse experience on specific websites (currently ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and Gemini)
            by adding a "Picture-in-Picture" (PIP) button to code blocks. Clicking this button opens the
            selected code block in a separate, always-on-top window, allowing you to view code while interacting
            with other parts of the page or other applications. The extension also keeps track of the code blocks for which PIP windows have been opened to manage these windows effectively.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Information I Do Not Collect</h2>
        <p>
            The Extension <strong>does not</strong>:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Collect any personally identifiable information (PII) such as your name, email address, IP address, or location.</li>
            <li>Collect or read the content of the code blocks you open in PIP windows.</li>
            <li>Track your Browse activity across websites, other than to identify code blocks on the supported platforms (ChatGPT, DeepSeek, Gemini) for the sole purpose of providing its functionality.</li>
            <li>Transmit any data from your browser or the web pages you visit to any servers.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Information the Extension Handles</h2>
        <p>
            The Extension operates entirely locally on your browser:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Functionality Data:</strong> To provide its features, the Extension identifies code block elements on the supported web pages. This process is done locally within your browser.</li>
            <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> The Extension may use your browser's local storage (e.g., `chrome.storage.local`) to save your preferences, such as the selected theme for the PIP window, or to keep track of active PIP windows. This information is stored only on your computer and is not accessible by me or any third parties.</li>
        </ul>


        <h2>4. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
        <p>
            Since PIP CodeWindow does not collect any personal information, there is no information for me to share or disclose.
            I do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer any data to outside parties.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Third-Party Websites</h2>
        <p>
            The Extension operates on third-party websites like ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and Gemini. This Privacy Policy
            only applies to the PIP CodeWindow Extension itself. I am not responsible for the privacy practices of
            these third-party websites. I encourage you to review their respective privacy policies.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Security</h2>
        <p>
            While the Extension itself doesn't handle sensitive personal data, Any data stored locally (like theme preferences) relies on the security mechanisms provided by your web browser.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
            I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected by an updated "Effective Date" at the top of this policy.
        </p>

        <h2>8. Contact Me</h2>
